/*Question 3: SQL vs. MongoDB
Explain the main differences between SQL databases and MongoDB in terms of data structure, querying
language, and use cases. Provide examples of scenarios where you might choose one over the other.


Answer
SQL databases use structured tables with rows and columns to store data, while MongoDB uses
flexible and dynamic documents in collections. SQL databases use SQL as a querying language, while
MongoDB uses a JavaScript-like syntax for queries. SQL databases are suitable for applications with
well-defined and structured data, such as financial systems. MongoDB is better for projects with changing or
unstructured data, like content management systems or real-time analytics.
