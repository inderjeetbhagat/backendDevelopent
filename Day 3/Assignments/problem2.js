/*Problem 2: JSON Manipulation
a) Define JSON and explain its importance in web development.
b) Given a JSON data string: {"name": "Alice", "age": 25, "hobbies": ["reading",
"painting"]}, explain how you would extract the value of the "age" key.
c) How would you convert the following object into a JSON data string? {"title": "Book", "pages":
200}
*/

/* a) JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data interchange format helps in transfer of data from
client to server. It is easy to read and write for humans and  it is easy for parse and generate for machines

b) const age = jsonObject.age;

c) const jsonString = JSON.stringify({"title": "Book", "pages":
200});
